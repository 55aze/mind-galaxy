description: Capture fleeting thoughts and organize them into doc/next.md
argument-hint: "[your fleeting thoughts/ideas]"

You are helping capture and organize fleeting thoughts for the Mind Galaxy project.

## Task

1. **Capture the user's input**: `$ARGUMENTS`

2. **Read existing next.md**: Check if `doc/next.md` exists and read its current content

3. **Organize and integrate**:
   - Parse the user's fleeting thoughts
   - Structure them into clear, concise bullet points
   - Categorize them appropriately (Visual & UX, Core Features, Project Management, etc.)
   - Merge with existing content without duplication
   - Maintain the existing structure and organization
   - Keep language concise and actionable

4. **Update doc/next.md**: Write the updated, organized content back to the file

5. **Confirm**: Show a brief summary of what was added/updated

## Guidelines

- Keep bullet points short and actionable
- Group related ideas together
- Avoid redundancy with existing items
- Maintain the "fleeting thoughts, not yet prioritized" nature
- If doc/next.md doesn't exist, create it with proper structure

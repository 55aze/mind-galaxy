# Next Tasks

*Fleeting thoughts and ideas - not yet prioritized*

## Visual & UX Improvements

- **Floating text readability** - Text currently overlaps nodes when hovering, making content hard to read
- **Cluster visual clarity** - Grouping logic needs readjustment; clusters still not visually obvious enough
- **Hierarchical clustering** - Two-layer cluster system: major clusters (max 5) containing sub-clusters to reduce visual overwhelm
- **Abstract-to-concrete cluster relationship** - Layer 1 (major) should show abstract themes, Layer 2 (sub) should show concrete specific topics (not copy-paste)
- **Improve zoom-in interaction threshold** - Node interactivity triggers too late; reduce zoom threshold for easier dot interaction

## Core Features

- **Dynamic thinker inspirations** - Currently static sentences; need to implement functional/dynamic generation
- **Cluster themes on load** - Show cluster themes/summaries before user clicks any node
- **Zoom-based cluster interaction**
  - Zoom out: Display blurred node clouds with cluster theme/summary overlay
  - Zoom in: Reveal individual nodes with details

## Search & Discovery

- **Semantic search** - Search by meaning/context, not just keyword matching
- **Connected thought search** - Find related thoughts, ideas, and themes through semantic connections
- **Conversational exploration** - Chat interface to query your thought nebula

## Intelligence & Interaction

- **Chat with your brain** - Interactive conversation with your accumulated thoughts and ideas
- **Thinker personas in context** - Talk to famous thinkers (Feynman, Jung, etc.) informed by your personal thought graph

## Voice Input

- **Voice input for thoughts** - Capture fleeting thoughts via voice recording/transcription

## Project Management Tools

- **Slash command: `/organize`** - AI-assisted organization and updates for this next.md file
- **Prioritization logic** - System to help prioritize tasks based on impact/effort
- **Slash command: `/next`** - Ask AI "what's next?" to maintain project momentum and get actionable suggestions

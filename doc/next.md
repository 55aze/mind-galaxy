# Next Tasks

*Fleeting thoughts and ideas - not yet prioritized*

## Visual & UX Improvements

- **Floating text readability** - Text currently overlaps nodes when hovering, making content hard to read
- **Cluster visual clarity** - Grouping logic needs readjustment; clusters still not visually obvious enough

## Core Features

- **Dynamic thinker inspirations** - Currently static sentences; need to implement functional/dynamic generation
- **Cluster themes on load** - Show cluster themes/summaries before user clicks any node
- **Zoom-based cluster interaction**
  - Zoom out: Display blurred node clouds with cluster theme/summary overlay
  - Zoom in: Reveal individual nodes with details

## Core Features

- **Voice input for thoughts** - Capture fleeting thoughts via voice recording/transcription

## Project Management Tools

- **Slash command: `/organize`** - AI-assisted organization and updates for this next.md file
- **Prioritization logic** - System to help prioritize tasks based on impact/effort
- **Slash command: `/next`** - Ask AI "what's next?" to maintain project momentum and get actionable suggestions
